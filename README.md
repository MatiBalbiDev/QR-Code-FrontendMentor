## My process

The process of creating this project had as a kick to start creating the html skeleton with the elements that we were going to use and then give it the necessary styles so that the result is as expected.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to learn how to center elements. I also learned how to give a minimum height value to an element.

```css
.main-container {
  display: block;
  width: 320px;
  min-height: 500px;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  border-radius: 10px;
  margin: 32px 28px 49px 28px;
}
```
